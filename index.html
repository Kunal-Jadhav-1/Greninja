              Greninja is a Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pokémon
              franchise, introduced in Pokémon X and Pokémon Y, that has since
              appeared across a wide variety of Pokémon media. It is the final
              evolution of Froakie, the Water-type starter Pokémon of X and Y,
              with either the ability 'Torrent' or 'Protean', with 'Battle Bond'
              as an event ability, enabling it to become Ash-Greninja, and the
              immediate evolution of Frogadier. Ash-Greninja has increased
              speed. Categorized as the "Ninja Pokémon", Greninja is a Water-
              and Dark-type Pokémon who is a frog-like master of swiftness and
              stealth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Greninja is a streamlined frog-like creature with dark blue skin
              and a beige underbelly, with long limbs and thin, slender physique
              particularly reminiscent of tree frogs. What resembles a pink
              scarf is actually its prehensile tongue wrapped around its head.
              Two long, ear-like protrusions extend from both sides of its head
              and connect with a smaller horn-like structure in the middle by
              azure blue-colored webbing. Spots of the same azure coloring can
              be found on each thigh, arguably resembling ninja stars or battle
              scars along with a stubby tail that wraps inwards.

                Greninja is a bipedal, frog-like Pokémon. It is mostly dark blue
                with a yellow chest, a white triangular marking over each eye, a
                light blue four-pointed star on each thigh, and yellow on the
                lower half of its face. It has red eyes with white pupils and
                its mouth is hidden behind a large, pink tongue that wraps
                around its neck and extends outward behind its head. Running
                down the middle of its head is a fin-like extension, and there
                is a similar fin on each side of its head. Light blue webbing
                connects its head fins.

                Greninja has an alternate form: Ash-Greninja. Through a process
                called the Bond Phenomenon, certain Greninja, such as Ash's
                Greninja in the anime, can change into an alternate form called
                Ash-Greninja. In this form, Greninja's skin turns a lighter
                shade of blue, while its face gains red stripes and its cheeks
                and side fins turn black, changing shape to resemble Ash's hair.
                Its legs are stronger in this form, and it gains the ability to
                form large Water Shurikens on its back. Ash-Greninja is always
                male. Ash-Greninja is the only known Pokémon that can have
                Battle Bond as an Ability.

                Water Shuriken boasts by far the greatest energy generation and
                is Greninja's preferred Fast Attack. Bubble deals very slightly
                more damage for considerably less energy gain, making it
                undesirable. Feint Attack is mediocre all around despite
                providing extra Dark-type damage. Night Slash costs the least
                amount of energy, benefits from STAB, can be used frequently,
                and has a small chance to proc its self-buff. Hydro Cannon is an
                excellent STAB move and can be fired rapidly thanks to Water
                Shuriken's insane energy generation. Surf is a good move, but is
                strictly inferior to Hydro Cannon as it deals less damage for
                the same energy cost.

            Greninja is a streamlined frog-like creature with dark blue skin and
            a beige underbelly, with long limbs and thin, slender physique
            particularly reminiscent of tree frogs. What resembles a pink scarf

            ear-like protrusions extend from both sides of its head and connect
            with a smaller horn-like structure in the middle by azure
            blue-colored webbing. Spots of the same azure coloring can be found
            on each thigh, arguably resembling ninja stars or battle scars along
            with a stubby tail that wraps inwards. Much like a frog, Greninja
            has webbed feet, wall-clinging suction cups on each digit, and
            powerful hind legs. It shoots streams of compressed water patterns
            from its palms. A large bubble can be found on each limb. A bipedal
            creature, Greninja can comfortably stand on its hind legs, but leans
            on one of its front limbs in a crouching stance when in battle. When
            at rest its eyes are white with hyphen-shaped pupils, but when
            engaged they gain red, oval-shapes irises, white pupils, and a
            narrow gaze. It only weighs 88.2 lbs. (40 kg), but is still quite
            tall at 4' 11" (1.5 m).

            Greninja is able to move with "a ninja's grace",[3] and has a design
            and set of abilities associated with Ninjutsu. Among its attacks are
            the formerly exclusive Water Shuriken, which lets it quickly fire
            throwing stars made from compressed water,[3] Shadow Sneak, and
            Double Team.[4] It is also the only Pokémon to learn Mat Block,
            which shields the user's side with a flipped-up mat. The Protean
            ability, which lets the user camouflage to the type of the attack it
            uses, is exclusive to Greninja and the chameleon Pokémon Kecleon (as
            well as the former's pre-evolutions). Capable of vanishing and
            reappearing quickly, it enjoys toying with enemies in such a
            manner.[3] It is very adaptable, learning many moves such as Bounce,
            Extrasensory, and Low Kick from different types.[4]

            It appeared prominently in the XYZ series of the Pokémon anime as
            one of Ash Ketchum's primary Pokémon, voiced by Yūji Ueda. This
            Greninja used its bond with Ash to transform into a unique and
            powerful form, Ash-Greninja, which was later released to the games
            as an empowered form of Greninja accessible to players of the
            Pokémon Sun and Moon Special Demo Version. Greninja was introduced
            as a playable fighter to the Super Smash Bros. franchise with Super
            Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U as one of the Pokémon series'
            five representatives, and was integrated into manga such as Pokémon
            Adventures. Greninja also appeared in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate on
            the Nintendo Switch. Greninja has been met with a very positive
            reception, quickly becoming one of the most popular Pokémon of the
            sixth generation.
